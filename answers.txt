What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Ans:    .gitignore specifies what files should be ignored when a user commits and pushes the changes made to files.
	It can also have patterns and directory name which tells Git to ignore the files of particular type or
	extension and the content of a directory.
	It should have following for a Java project(# means comment):
	# Compiled class file
	*.class

	# Log file
	*.log

	# BlueJ files
	*.ctxt

	# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
	.mtj.tmp/

	# Package Files #
	*.jar
	*.war
	*.nar
	*.ear
	*.zip
	*.tar.gz
	*.rar

What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Ans:	When a commit can be reached by tracing the previous commit's history, git simply moves the pointer to the
	latest commit so that there is no 'manual' following of the commit history. This is called fast-forward.
Why should you have different branches?
Ans:	The project should always have a working software in one of the branches which is usually the 'master' branch.
	When implementing new features or fixing bugs, branches are very helpful since they don't affect the master branch
	and the project is safe.
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Ans:	When a project has a single or initial version, there is only one remote repository. But, when the project
	has more than version, it good and recommended to host more than one remote repository.
